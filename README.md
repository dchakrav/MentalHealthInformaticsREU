# Project overview

This project was created by David Kucher, Reilly Grant, and Ana Le√≥n, 
under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Gemmell. It was created while
participating in Depaul University's 2017 summer Medical Informatics REU(MedIX).
The goal of this project is to use the word2vec algorithm to find patterns
in the words used to talk about mental health by analyzing reddit data. Reddit
data is obtained by using the archive at https://files.pushshift.io 
created and maintained by reddit user u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix.

To replicate our analysis on a new data set, look at the analysis_template directory.
To mine data from reddit, look at the reddit scrapper directory.
Finally, to mine association rules, check out the association_miner directory.
