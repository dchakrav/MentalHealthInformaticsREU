# word2vec Analysis

These files are used to run the word2vec algorithm on
a collection of csv files.

We ommited the models directory, and the data directory from this repository.
The data directory holds all csv files, which contain a field to be used in 
the models, while the models directory contains all the saved models 
generated by our code.

We used the gensim library to run word2vec. Their website is here:

and their tutorial on word2vec is here:
